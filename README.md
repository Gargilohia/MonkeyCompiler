### Monkey Compiler


This repository follows the following book  : https://compilerbook.com/

In essence the agenda is to learn how compilers work by creating a simple compiler that has a lexer, parser and uses ASTs.
Monkey language doesn't officially exist but is a brainchild of this book's author.
The compiler is written using Golang.
